============

Data is provided through a certain *backend* in Open Personen. A backend 
provides the technical details to connect to a certain data source.

There are currently 2 backends available:

* **StUF-BG** - Allows Open Personen to connect to a StUF-BG compatible service
  to retrieve person data.
* **Demo** - Provides a local testset of persons to use for testing purposes.
