Introduction
============

Open Personen offers an implementation of the 
`Haal Centraal BRP bevragen API specification`_ and can optionally connect to 
a `StUF-BG`_ service to retrieve locally stored personal data. It can also
expose fake data for testing purposes.

Open Personen meets the need for several other components to request personal 
data and to link persons (e.g. to a zaak in the `Open Zaak`_). A so-called 
Profile API is also available where additional, non-authentic, personal data 
can be stored such as a phone number and an email address.

The project is designed line with the `Common Ground`_ model and works well 
with other API's and components in this model.
