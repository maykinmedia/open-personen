The Open Personen project was initiated by Maykin Media to allow other API's
in the Common Ground domain to easily retrieve personal data via a modern API
and reference persons at the source rather than copying personal data to their
own storage.

Here is an inevitably incomplete list of MUCH-APPRECIATED CONTRIBUTORS --
people who laid the groundwork, have submitted patches, reported bugs, added
translations, helped answer questions, and generally made Open Personen that 
much better:

    Joeri Bekker <joeri@maykinmedia.nl>
    Shea Meyers <shea@maykinmedia.nl>
    Steven Bal <steven@maykinmedia.nl>

A big THANK YOU goes to:

    The Haal Centraal project team for creating a modern API specification for
    retrieving personal data.

    All people behind Common Ground for their enthusiasm and vision.
